# CSCI-1420-Capstone

## Overview

This project examines factors in length of hospital stay using the Healthcare Analytics II dataset which can be found on kaggle. The goal is to predict length of patient stay depending only on information avaliable at time of check in. Two different models are used, a standared multi-layered perceptron model and a random forest classificaiton model. The best model achieved an accuracy of 30%, which was greater than the baseline accuracy.
